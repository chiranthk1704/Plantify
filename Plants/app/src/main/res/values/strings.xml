        About This App\n
        Welcome to our innovative Plant Species Recognition App! \n
        This application leverages advanced ML models,including ResNet and YOLOv8, to accurately identify plant species based on leaf images.\n\n

        Key Features:\n
        1. High Accuracy Recognition: Uses deep learning models for precise plant species identification.\n
        2. User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive design makes it easy to capture or upload images.\n
        3. Real-Time Analysis: Instantly processes images and provides detailed species information.\n
        4. Educational Insights: Learn about various models performance and techniques.\n\n

        How It Works:\n
        1. Capture or upload an image of a plant leaf.\n
        2. The app analyzes the image using ResNet and YOLOv8 models.\n
        3. Results are displayed, providing the name and details of the plant species.\n\n

        Technology Behind the App:\n
        - ResNet (Residual Network): Utilized for feature extraction and accurate classification.\n
        - YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once): Enables precise object detection to identify leaf boundaries and features.\n\n

        Team Credits:\n
        Developed by Chirag C , Chiranth k , Anirudh K , Prajwal Y .\n\n
